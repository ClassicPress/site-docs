## Improved Shortcode Control

Shortcodes Everywhere will help you quickly enable shortcodes in any context on your ClassicPress website! Posts, pages, excerpts, widgets, category and tag descriptions – even user comments – you decide where you want shortcodes to run and the plugin takes care of the rest!

## Enable or Disable Shortcodes

If you need to _disable_ shortcodes from running in any given context, this plugin has got your back! Not only can you enable shortcodes to run in additional contexts, you can also _disable_ them from running in any of those contexts, too, giving you more control than ever.
If shortcodes are present in a context where they are disabled, nothing will show up: they’re fully stripped.

## Quick Setup

Setup will take less than 30 seconds – and that accounts for a 15 second break in the middle! Just check a few boxes and you're done!
